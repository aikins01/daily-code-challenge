 * The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.
 *
 * More rigorously, we can define it as follows:
 *
 * The horizontal distance of the root is 0.
 * The horizontal distance of a left child is hd(parent) - 1.
 * The horizontal distance of a right child is hd(parent) + 1.
