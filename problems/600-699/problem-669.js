 * The game of Nim is played as follows. Starting with three heaps, each containing a variable number of items, two players
 * take turns removing one or more items from a single pile. The player who eventually is forced to take the last stone loses.
 *
 * Given a list of non-zero starting values [a, b, c], and assuming optimal play, determine whether the first player has a
 * forced win.
